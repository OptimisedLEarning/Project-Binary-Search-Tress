    <h1>Binary Search Tree</h1>
    <h2>### 2. Tree Class/Factory</h2>

    <h3>
      Instructions - Build a `Tree` class/factory which accepts an array when
      initialized. <br />
      - The `Tree` class should have a `root` attribute, which uses the return
      value of `buildTree` (which you’ll write next).<br />
      - The `Tree` class should also have a `prettyPrint()` method that will
      `console.log` the tree in a structured format. ---
    </h3>

    <h2>### 3. buildTree(array) Function</h2>
    <h3>
      - Write a `buildTree(array)` <br />
      function that takes an array of data (e.g., `[1, 7, 4, 23, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5,
      7, 9, 67, 6345, 324]`) and turns it into a **balanced binary tree** full
      of Node objects appropriately placed (don’t forget to sort and remove
      duplicates!).<br />
      - The `buildTree` function should return the level-0 root node. --- >
      **Tip:** If you would like to visualize your binary search tree, here is a
      `prettyPrint()` function that will `console.log` your tree in a structured
      format. This function will expect to receive the root of your tree as the
      value for the `node` parameter. ```
